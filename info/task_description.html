        "di-dah di-di-di-dit di-dah-dah di-dah-dah-dah dah-di-dit dah-di-di-dah",
        sound of Morszelizer clanked out loud.<br><br>

        "What're you doing?" Nikola asked curiously.<br><br>

        "I'm sending our time logs for the last expedition to headquarters, but it's not an easy task..." Stephen grumbled, "Can you imagine that with all the computer power at our disposal, I STILL have to convert this message to Morse-code with only an on/off button... Hrmph... what a pain." He grumbled at the inconvenience.<br><br>

        "Let me look at it." Nikola offered his help, "It looks like a pretty easy solution, we could
        automate the process."<br><br>

        "Oh.. you hero of my day." Stephen started excitedly. "So, how do we start
        it?"<br><br>

        "With Python!" Nikola exclaimed.

<p>Help Stephen to automate his task by creating a module. 
    As you can see in above illustration, gray circle means on, and white circle means off. 
    Every digit in the time string contains a different number of slots. 
    The first digit for the hour has a length of 2 while the second digit for the hour has a length of 4. 
    The first digits for the minute and second not have a length of 3 while the second digits for the minute and second have a length of 4. 
    Every digit in the time is converted to binary representation. 
    You will convert every on ( or 1 ) signal to dash ( - ) and every off ( or 0 ) signal to dot ( . )

    <strong>Output: </strong> A string of Morse symbol from binary representation with specific format:
<pre style="text-align: center;">"h h : m m : s s"</pre>
where each digits represented as sequence of "." and "-"
