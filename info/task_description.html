        "di-dah di-di-di-dit di-dah-dah di-dah-dah-dah dah-di-dit dah-di-di-dah",
        sound of Morszelizer clanked out loud.<br><br>

        "What're you doing?" Nikola asked curiously.<br><br>

        "I'm sending our time logs for the last expedition to headquarters, but it's not an easy task..." Stephen grumbled, "Can you imagine that with all the computer power at our disposal, I STILL have to convert this message to Morse-code with only an on/off button... Hrmph... what a pain." He grumbled at the inconvenience.<br><br>

        "Let me look at it." Nikola offered his help, "It looks like a pretty easy solution, we could
        automate the process."<br><br>

        "Oh.. you hero of my day." Stephen started excitedly. "So, how do we start
        it?"<br><br>

        "With Python!" Nikola exclaimed.

<p>Help Stephen to automate his task with creating module. As you could see on
    illustration, gray circle means on, and white circle means off. every digit
    in time string, contains different slot. First digit for hour contains 2
    length. Second digit for hour contains 4 length. First digit for minute and
    second, contains 3 length. And second digit for minute and hour, contains 4
    length. Every digit in time is converted to binary representation. Then, for
    ease of this task, you will converted every on ( or 1 ) signal to dash ( - )
    and every off ( or 0 ) signal to dot ( . )
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A time string ( could be hh:mm:ss or h:m:s format depends on digit length )
</p>

<div>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A string of Morse symbol from binary representation with specific format:
<pre style="text-align: center;">"h h : m m : s s"</pre>
where each digits represented as sequence of "." and "-"
